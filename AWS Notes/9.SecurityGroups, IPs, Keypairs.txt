Security Groups
+++++++++++++++

-> AWS providing security for our virtual machines using Security Groups

-> Security Groups will decide who can access our instance/ server / VM & what our Instance can access

-> In Every Security Group we will have 2 types of rules

			1) Inbound Rules

			2) Outbound Rules

-> Inbound rules will decide who can access our instance

-> Outbound rules will decide what our machine can access


Note: To create EC2 instance Security Group is Mandatory.

In General, we will add below Inbound Rules in Security Grous
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For Windows Machines we will use ==> RDP - 3389

For Linux Machines we will use  ==> SSH - 22

For WebServers ==> HTTP - 80

For WebServer + SSL (Secure Socket Layer)  ==> HTTPS - 443


Note: We can configure particular IP also in security group.

-> If we want to allow all traffic then we will configure "0.0.0.0/0"

Note: AWS Security Groups will help you to configure which traffic we can allow. We can't configure Traffic Deny rules in Security Groups.

      ( Security Groups support for only ALLOW, it doesn't support for DENY )

	Q: Could u pls tell me how to allow http request for my EC2 
	A: To allow the http request we can configure http port 80
	
	Q: CAn u tell me how to allow RDP request for my EC2?
	A: To allow the RDP request we can configure EDP port 3389

	Q: Can u tell me how to allow SSH request for my EC2?
	A: To allow the SSH request we can configure SSH port 22

	Q: Can u tell me how to allow HTTPS request for my EC2?
	A: To allow the HTTPS request we can configure HTTPS port 443

	Q: Do i need to configure all the ports(22 , 80 , 3389 , 443) in security group
	A: Not required Based on the requirement only we can configure,  It depends upon what are u doing in the machine, in the EC2 which OS is available do u have windows/linux/webserver/ webserver ssl
	   - To connect with windows we need RDP
	   - For Linux we need SSH
	   - For webserver we need HTTP
	   - For webserver+ssl we need HTTPS
	
	Q: Can i block particular IP Address by using Security group
	A: No
		EX: One of my friend is available he is having computer, i dont want to allow my friend to access my machine, can i block only my friend to access my machine
		Ans : no
	Q: what we can do with the security groups
	A: With the Security group u can configure only who can access it has only ALLOW option, it doesnt have the DENY option


Note: If we want to configure DENY rules functionality then we should go for NACL concept.

		NACL -> Network Access Control List

Note : SecurityGroups are Not Chargable in AWS(AWS will not charge for the security group creation

Types of IPs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> IP stands for Internet Protocol

-> IP is called as Address of the computer

-> For every computer IP is mandatory to connect with Internet

-> In AWS, we can see 3 types of IPS

		1) Private IP

		2) Public IP

		3) Elastic IP (Static IP)


-> When we launch EC2 instance, AWS will assign one Private IP for our instance (For Internal Purpose)

		Note: We can't connect to EC2 using private ip from outside

-> To connect with EC2 instance from outside we need Public IP. 

-> When we launch EC2 instance, AWS will assign one public IP i.e temporary ip. When we re-start our EC2 instance public ip getting changed.

-> If you want a static ip for your instance then you should go for Elastic IPs.
	( If i dont want to change my IP even if i start or stop my EC2 then we can go for Elastic IP)


Note: When we create Elastic IP, we have to associate(use) that Elastic IP with EC2 instance

-> when you are not using the Elastic IP  you have to Release the Elastic Ip , If you keep Elastic IP idle then bill will be generated.
-> If u create Elastic IP and dont use then also the bill will be generated so u should not keep the Elastic IP idle 

Note: In Free tier, 5 Elastic IPs are free.

Note : Elastic IPs are Chargable

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Pair
+++++++++++

-> If u want to connect EC2 instanc securely then u need a keypair, u can associate a keypair to EC2 instance

-> Their are 2 types of keypairs are available
	1.RSA
	2.EDS
	(Note: RSA keypair will support for all instances but EDS support only for Mac & linux)
-> keypair formats in 2 types 
	1.pem format
	2.ppk format

Note : Keypairs are Not chargable
